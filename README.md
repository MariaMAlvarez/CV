# Web Development
These are the projects I have done during [The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).

Feel free to explore them by opening the folder of each project and clicking on the link to check them out. 

They are ordered by the order I completed them, so the simplest ones are in the beggining and the more advanced towards the end.
