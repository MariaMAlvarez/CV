# Personal Site

This was the second capstone project of the bootcamp, corresponding to the CSS module.

Here I created a personal website based on HTML as before, but also leveragiing CSS components, including Flexbox, Grid and Bootstrap.
It has my most important achievments and some other informations to get to know me better.
