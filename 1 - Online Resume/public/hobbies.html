    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>Here I have a few of my hobbies so you can get to know me a litle bit better.</p>
    <h2>Crochet</h2>
    <p>I just started to learn how to crochet. I'm currently making a blaket out of daisy granny squares. Check out my <a href="https://www.allaboutami.com/cozy-days-daisy-blanket/">inspo</a> for this project.</p>
    <p>The blanket will eventually look like this:</p> <img src="../assets/cozy-days-daisy-blanket.jpg" height="270px">
    <h2>Sewing</h2>
    <p>I've been learning how to sew for a couple of years. It started out as making simple modifications to clothes or fixing something. However I've also made some napkins, book covers and I'm, currently working on a bigger <a href="https://www.moodfabrics.com/blog/the-elderberry-dress-free-sewing-pattern/">project</a>. This dress will be made with a red polka doted fabric and the end result will resemble something like this:</p>

    <h2>Cooking & Baking</h2>
    <p>Another one of my passions is cooking and baking. I learned everything I know from my parents that made sure I tried different tastes and cuizines all my childhood. My favorite foods involve either pasta or chocolate. Lately I've been trying other disshes and pastries, such as <a href="https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/chocolate-babka-chocolate-brioche-bread">babka</a> or macarrons, and other combinations of flavours. Here you can check out some of my favorite inspirations, like <a href="https://preppykitchen.com/">Preppy Kitchen</a> and <a href="https://www.joshuaweissman.com/">Joshua Weissman</a>.</p>
    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <p>Thanks to my brother I also like to spend some of my free time gaming. Here you can see my favorite games:          </p>
