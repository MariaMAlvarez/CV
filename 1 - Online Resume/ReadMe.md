# Online Resume

This was my first project, which corresponds to the HTML module, therefore, only HTML was used.

Here I created an online resume. It has my most important achievments and some other informations to get to know me better.

In this website I used all the elements taught in the module and some others, such as headers, paragraphs, images, anchors, lists, tables, etc.
