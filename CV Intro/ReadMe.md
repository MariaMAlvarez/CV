# CV Intro

This was the first website I made, which is a simple copy of my CV.

It is mostly a HTML project with a litle bit of CSS, mostly for background color.

I learned how to make hyperlinks to other pages on the web, other pages I created, making tables, inserting images and connecting a CSS file for styling.
