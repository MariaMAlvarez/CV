<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Maria, an engineering student pursuind a programming career. 
  I'm currently on the last of a Master's Degree in Micro and Nanotechnologies Engineering
  and doing my best to develop my programming skills, like with this Web Dev Course.</p>

 <p>In this semester I'm writing my thesis which consists of developing a user-friendly software so anyone
  can use specific sensors developed in the labs at my university. The sensors are used to detect heavy
   metals in bodies of water and the new thing about these sensors is that they are small and easy to manufacture
   and use. This means that, if a portable platform is created, then these measurements can be done in situ, in 
   a fast and efficient way. My tasks include understanding the previosly created electrical circuit, writing code 
   to communicate with the circuit and sensor through a microcontroler, writing code to analyze the data from the sensor and
   development of dashboards, accompanying the sensor's fabrication, developing better electrical circuits and 
   replace the electrical circuit with a simpler and much smaller chip. </p>
